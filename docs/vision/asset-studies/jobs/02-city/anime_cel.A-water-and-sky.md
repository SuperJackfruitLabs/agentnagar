## Prompt

Submit exactly this text.

```text
Use case: stylized-concept
Asset type: game asset design sheet: the target that a 3D model will be built to
Primary request: a clean design sheet of 3 separate things, each drawn as a finished game model in the style of the reference images
Input images: Image 1: style reference (the park panel); Image 2: style reference (the rooftop panel); Image 3: style reference (the diagonal panel). These are panels from the concept sheets of the Cel-shaded anime style. Take from them only how this style renders, colours and builds things like this. Do not copy their composition, scenery, people or captions.
Scene/backdrop: one plain mid-grey backdrop (about #B8B8B8) across the whole canvas, with no floor line, horizon, scenery, sky or people; a soft gradient in the grey is fine; a soft contact shadow under each object and nothing else
Subject: 3 separate objects, in reading order. 1. A small sailing boat: hull about 5 m long, mast 6.8 m, with one or two sails. 2. A cloud about 10 m long with a flat base. 3. A smaller cloud about 8 m long with a flat base. Where a note above does not say how this style draws an object, use the style's own materials: deep blue water with white sparkle strokes.
Style/medium: cel-shaded anime background art, drawn as a clean toon-shaded 3D game model: flat colour fills, two steps of cool lavender-grey shadow, thin dark ink lines on silhouettes and main edges
Composition/framing: landscape canvas, 1536 x 1024, divided into three equal columns with clear empty backdrop between them. One object in each, centred, in three-quarter view from the front-right with the camera raised about 30 degrees, drawn as large as its cell allows. Every object stands well clear of its neighbours and of the canvas edge: no part or shadow of one reaches another. Under each object: a short row of flat square colour swatches, one for each of its main materials.
Lighting/mood: clear even daylight from the upper left; each surface keeps one flat colour, with a single darker step only on the faces turned away from the light; no shadow shapes or streaks painted across a flat face, no coloured light, no long cast shadows
Color palette: deep blue water with white sparkles; indigo and vermilion
Materials/textures: flat fills with a hard-edged shadow step and small painted highlights; brick, planks and paving joints drawn as a few thin lines; foliage as layered clusters of small leaf shapes
Constraints: exactly 3 objects, each whole, inside its own cell and touching nothing; made of a small number of solid, simple parts that a low-polygon game model can reproduce, with nothing wire-thin: legs, rails, stems and branches drawn sturdy; no text, letters, numbers, labels, captions, arrows, dimension lines, logos, signatures or watermark anywhere
Avoid: scenery, extra props, people other than the subject, perspective distortion, depth of field, bloom, heavy cast shadows, photorealism, soft airbrushed gradients, heavy black outlines, chibi proportions, lens flare

## Before saving, look at the image

- The canvas is landscape, close to 3:2.
- The backdrop is plain grey with no scenery, floor or people (a soft gradient in the grey is fine).
- There are exactly 3 objects, each whole and inside the canvas.
- There is no readable text, label or number anywhere.
- It reads as this style's concept sheets do, and as something a simple game model could reproduce.
