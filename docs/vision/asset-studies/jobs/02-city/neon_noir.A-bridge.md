```text
Use case: stylized-concept
Asset type: game asset design sheet: the target that a 3D model will be built to
Primary request: a clean design sheet of one thing, the north bridge, drawn as a finished game model in the style of the reference images
Input images: Image 1: style reference (the park panel); Image 2: style reference (the diagonal panel); Image 3: style reference (the rooftop panel). These are panels from the concept sheets of the Neon noir style. Take from them only how this style renders, colours and builds things like this. Do not copy their composition, scenery, people or captions.
Scene/backdrop: one plain mid-grey backdrop (about #B8B8B8) across the whole canvas, with no floor line, horizon, scenery, sky or people; a soft gradient in the grey is fine; a soft contact shadow under each object and nothing else
Subject: The north bridge: one low stone bridge of three equal spans, each about 8 m long on piers about 1.5 m thick, with a deck about 4.3 m wide between railings, and beside it a length of quay wall about 2.5 m high. Low and level. No towers taller than a lamp post and no cables. In this style: A pale low arch bridge with a line of warm lights along the deck. Character notes: The oldest structure after the tree. Its middle pier still carries the mark of the highest flood.
Style/medium: neon noir city design, drawn as a clean stylised 3D game model: dark charcoal and navy forms with slim lines of built-in light, softly shaded, no outlines
Composition/framing: landscape canvas, 1536 x 1024. Top two-thirds: one large three-quarter view from the front-right with the camera raised about 30 degrees, the whole of its length in frame. Bottom third: a straight-on side elevation running the width of the canvas. In the bottom right corner: a row of flat square colour swatches, one for each of these, in this order: stone, deck, railing, quay wall, water.
Lighting/mood: neutral soft studio light from the upper left so that the true surface colours read, with the object's own lamps and light strips switched on and glowing; no night scene, no rain, no coloured light on the backdrop; every surface is drawn in its own colour, as neutral light shows it; lamps, lanterns and light strips are drawn switched on as small bright parts, but their light does not fall on the object, the ground or the backdrop: no glow on leaves, bark, walls or seats, no halo and no pool of light
Color palette: dark concrete, #2F2322 to #5C4A45; matte charcoal and black; dark navy water
Materials/textures: matte dark metal and concrete, dark timber with a faint grain, glass that glows from behind, thin strips of warm or coloured light set into edges; wet stone only where a scene asks for it
Constraints: one thing only, shown more than once as the same object with the same parts and colours; made of a small number of solid, simple parts that a low-polygon game model can reproduce, with nothing wire-thin: legs, rails, stems and branches drawn sturdy; no text, letters, numbers, labels, captions, arrows, dimension lines, logos, signatures or watermark anywhere
Avoid: scenery, extra props, people other than the subject, perspective distortion, depth of field, bloom, heavy cast shadows, daylight scenes, dirt and decay, weapons, dystopian signage, heavy fog, lens flare over the object, photorealism, photographic materials and lighting

## Before saving, look at the image

- The canvas is landscape, close to 3:2.
- The backdrop is plain grey with no scenery, floor or people (a soft gradient in the grey is fine).
- There is one thing only, whole in every view, and the views show the same object.
- There is no readable text, label or number anywhere.
- It reads as this style's concept sheets do, and as something a simple game model could reproduce.
- It is not a night scene: every surface shows its own colour, and only the lamps themselves are bright.
