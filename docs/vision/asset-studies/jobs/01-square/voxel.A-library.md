## Reference images

Load each with `view_image`, in this order, before generating. This job is a new image, not an edit.

1. `refs/panels/voxel/street.jpg` — style reference: the street panel of this style's concept sheets
2. `refs/panels/voxel/gathering.jpg` — style reference: the gathering panel of this style's concept sheets
3. `refs/panels/voxel/diagonal.jpg` — style reference: the diagonal panel of this style's concept sheets

## Prompt

Submit exactly this text.

```text
Use case: stylized-concept
Asset type: game asset design sheet: the target that a 3D model will be built to
Primary request: a clean design sheet of one thing, the library, drawn as a finished game model in the style of the reference images
Input images: Image 1: style reference (the street panel); Image 2: style reference (the gathering panel); Image 3: style reference (the diagonal panel). These are panels from the concept sheets of the Voxel style. Take from them only how this style renders, colours and builds things like this. Do not copy their composition, scenery, people or captions.
Scene/backdrop: one plain mid-grey backdrop (about #B8B8B8) across the whole canvas, with no floor line, horizon, scenery, sky or people; a soft gradient in the grey is fine; a soft contact shadow under each object and nothing else
Subject: The library: a broad two-storey building with a rounded reading-room roof about 9 m across. Its walls are bays 2 m wide and 8 m high with tall openings and slim columns; the entrance is 3.2 m wide with double doors; two hanging banners about 1.2 m by 4.3 m flank it. Broad and calm, lower than the towers behind it. The banners carry one simple book or leaf emblem. In this style: An orange barrel-vaulted hall of cubes with a white end arch and a cobalt-blue glazed entrance. Character notes: The reading room came first and the wings were added as the collection grew. The banners are changed with the seasons.
Style/medium: voxel 3D game model, seen as a clean render: forms built from cubes on one grid, with stepped edges where a curve would be; only the largest roofs (the workshop's sawtooth, the library's vault) are drawn smooth; no outlines
Composition/framing: landscape canvas, 1536 x 1024. Left two-thirds: one large three-quarter view from the front-right with the camera raised about 30 degrees, the whole of it in frame with a clear margin. Right third, stacked: a straight-on front elevation above, a straight-down plan view below. Along the bottom edge: a row of flat square colour swatches, one for each of these, in this order: wall, rounded roof, columns and trim, glass, banner.
Lighting/mood: bright even daylight from the upper left, soft shading between cubes, no coloured light, no hard cast shadows
Color palette: a bright yellow workshop, an orange library vault, white and cobalt-glass towers, grey stone base courses; a warm yellow glow; orange, cobalt and emerald
Materials/textures: one flat saturated colour on each cube, with a slight tone difference from cube to cube and soft shading where cubes meet; no painted texture inside a cube face
Constraints: one thing only, shown more than once as the same object with the same parts and colours; made of a small number of solid, simple parts that a low-polygon game model can reproduce, with nothing wire-thin: legs, rails, stems and branches drawn sturdy; no text, letters, numbers, labels, captions, arrows, dimension lines, logos, signatures or watermark anywhere
Avoid: scenery, extra props, people other than the subject, perspective distortion, depth of field, bloom, heavy cast shadows, smooth or rounded surfaces, diagonal slopes, textures inside cube faces, ink outlines, tiny noisy cubes

## Before saving, look at the image

- The canvas is landscape, close to 3:2.
- The backdrop is plain grey with no scenery, floor or people (a soft gradient in the grey is fine).
- There is one thing only, whole in every view, and the views show the same object.
- There is no readable text, label or number anywhere.
- It reads as this style's concept sheets do, and as something a simple game model could reproduce.

## Save

```sh
python3 tools/intake.py add voxel.A-library PATH_TO_THE_GENERATED_IMAGE
```

It files the image as `sheets/voxel/A-library/rNNN/image.png` with its prompt and its record.
