```text
Use case: stylized-concept
Asset type: game asset design sheet: the target that a 3D model will be built to
Primary request: a clean design sheet of one thing, the fountain, drawn as a finished game model in the style of the reference images
Input images: Image 1: style reference (the street panel); Image 2: style reference (the park panel). These are panels from the concept sheets of the Cel-shaded anime style. Take from them only how this style renders, colours and builds things like this. Do not copy their composition, scenery, people or captions.
Scene/backdrop: one plain mid-grey backdrop (about #B8B8B8) across the whole canvas, with no floor line, horizon, scenery, sky or people; a soft gradient in the grey is fine; a soft contact shadow under each object and nothing else
Subject: The square's fountain: a round basin 3 m across with a rim 45 cm high and broad enough to sit on, and a centre piece about 1.9 m high from which water falls into the basin. People sit on the rim facing out, so the rim is flat and plain. In this style: The concept sheets do not show this closely, so design it to belong with what they do show, in this style's own materials: broad timber planks from dark brown to honey; near-black iron in slim bars; grey stone with a few joint lines. Character notes: A gift from the first makers to pass their trial. They signed it under the rim, where nobody looks.
Style/medium: cel-shaded anime background art, drawn as a clean toon-shaded 3D game model: flat colour fills, two steps of cool lavender-grey shadow, thin dark ink lines on silhouettes and main edges
Composition/framing: landscape canvas, 1536 x 1024. Left two-thirds: one large three-quarter view from the front-right with the camera raised about 30 degrees, the whole of it in frame with a clear margin. Right third, stacked: a straight-on front elevation above, a straight-down plan view below. Along the bottom edge: a row of flat square colour swatches, one for each of these, in this order: basin stone, rim, centre piece, water.
Lighting/mood: clear even daylight from the upper left; each surface keeps one flat colour, with a single darker step only on the faces turned away from the light; no shadow shapes or streaks painted across a flat face, no coloured light, no long cast shadows
Color palette: grey stone, #5D5C61 to #A29493; deep blue water with white sparkles
Materials/textures: flat fills with a hard-edged shadow step and small painted highlights; brick, planks and paving joints drawn as a few thin lines; foliage as layered clusters of small leaf shapes
Constraints: one thing only, shown more than once as the same object with the same parts and colours; made of a small number of solid, simple parts that a low-polygon game model can reproduce, with nothing wire-thin: legs, rails, stems and branches drawn sturdy; no text, letters, numbers, labels, captions, arrows, dimension lines, logos, signatures or watermark anywhere
Avoid: scenery, extra props, people other than the subject, perspective distortion, depth of field, bloom, heavy cast shadows, photorealism, soft airbrushed gradients, heavy black outlines, chibi proportions, lens flare

## Before saving, look at the image

- The canvas is landscape, close to 3:2.
- The backdrop is plain grey with no scenery, floor or people (a soft gradient in the grey is fine).
- There is one thing only, whole in every view, and the views show the same object.
- There is no readable text, label or number anywhere.
- It reads as this style's concept sheets do, and as something a simple game model could reproduce.
